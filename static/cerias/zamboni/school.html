<H1>School and Work</H1>

<H2>Summary</H2>

<P>I am a graduate student in the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/">Computer Sciences Department</A> at
<A HREF="http://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</A>. I work at <a
href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/">CERIAS</a>, and my advisor is <A
HREF="https://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu">Prof. Gene Spafford</A>.</P>

<H2>School </H2>

<p>In January of 2000 I passed my preliminary exam, which consists of
the presentation of my thesis proposal, and was the last official
requirement before I can graduate. There's the slight issue of
finishing a thesis, of course. You can read more about that in my <a
href="thesis/">thesis page</a>.</p>

<p>Periodically I get requests from people who are interested in
coming to Purdue for graduate studies. You can read all about the
academic programs and requirements at the CS department in the <a
href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/grad-info/gradinfo/">Graduate
Information page</a>. Of course, feel free to email me anyway, but
that should get you started on some information.</p>

<H2><a name="research">Research interests</a></H2>

<P>I am primarily interested in computer and network security, which
is, basically, why I am at Purdue. <a href="https://www.cerias.purdue.edu">CERIAS</a>
is the perfect place to learn and do research in this field.</P>

<p>My thesis research deals with the use of low-level components for
building intrusion detection systems. You can read all the details in
my <a href="thesis/">thesis page</a>.</p>

<H2>Projects</H2>

<P>I am or have been involved in the following projects at the COAST
lab or CERIAS:</P>

	  Project (ESP)</a>. This is my main project for now, as it is
	based on my thesis work.
      <li><a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/homes/aafid/">The
	  Autonomous Agents for Intrusion Detection (AAFID)
	  project.</a></li>
