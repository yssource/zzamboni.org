    <h1>Diego Zamboni's thesis work</h1>

    <p>My Ph.D. dissertation is called <em>Using Internal Sensors for
    Computer Intrusion Detection</em> (
    <a href="../pubs/thesis-techreport.ps">PostScript</a>: 1.1MB,
    <a href="../pubs/thesis-techreport.pdf">PDF</a>:
    519KB), and is the basis for the <a
    href="http://projects.cerias.purdue.edu/esp/">ESP project</a> at <a href="https://www.cerias.purdue.edu">CERIAS</a>. Read
    on for a more detailed description (of course, read the dissertation
    for the full details).</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>Most of my research at <a href="https://www.cerias.purdue.edu">CERIAS</a> has been in the
    area of intrusion detection. I worked in the <a
    href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/homes/aafid/">AAFID</a> project, which showed the
    feasibility of using small independent components (called
    "autonomous agents" in AAFID) for performing intrusion
    detection.</p>

    <p>However, AAFID also exposed some of the problems of the
    approach. One particularly limiting problem, shared by virtually
    every existing intrusion detection system, is that of using
    separate processes for the intrusion detection components. The use
    of separate processes means that the intrusion detection sytem
    imposes a constant overhead on the systems where the components
    are running (because of the overhead caused by the extra
    process(es)), that it is vulnerable to tampering or disabling by
    an attacker (if he manages to kill or otherwise disable the
    intrusion detection processes) and in some cases, that is
    scalability is limited (in the current implementation of AAFID
    each agent is implemented as a separate process, which limits the
    maximum number of agents that can be running on a single host).</p>

    <p>This caused my work to shift towards lower-level components,
    which I now call <em>internal sensors</em> and <em>embedded
    detectors</em>. Briefly, they are defined as follows:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Internal sensor:</b>
      <dd> A piece of software (potentially aided by a hardware
      component) that monitors a specific variable, activity or
      condition of a program and that is an integral part of the
      program being monitored.<p>
      <dt><b>Embedded detector:</b>
      <dd> An internal sensor that has added logic for detecting
      conditions that indicate a specific attack or intrusion.
    </dl>

    <p>Internal sensors and embedded detectors have a number of
    advantages, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li> They are much more resistent to tampering or disabling,
	because they are part of the program they monitor. If the
	sensor/detector is properly implemented, disabling it would mean
	killing the program!
      
      <li> They impose a very low CPU overhead on the system, because they 
	are not executing continuously, only when the section of code
	they are monitoring is executed.

      <li> They perform <em>direct monitoring</em> because they have
      access to the internal data of the program they are
      monitoring. The data does not have to traverse through an
      external path (a log file, for example) between its generation
      and its use. This reduces the chances that the data will be
      modified (either by accident, by system failure, or by malicious
      action) before an intrusion detection component gets it.

    </ul>

    <p>They also have some disadvantages, mainly that their
    implementation is completely dependent on the program in which
    they are implemented.</p>

    <h2>My research</h2>

    <p>My thesis research is on showing that it is possible to build
    an intrusion detection system based on internal sensors and
    embedded detectors, on investigating the characteristics and
    limitations of such a system, and on the possibility that such a
    system could be used to detect new attacks without the need to
    constantly implement new sensors and detectors.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>The ESP project</h2>

    <p>My thesis research is the base for the <a href="http://projects.cerias.purdue.edu/esp/">ESP
    project</a> at CERIAS. ESP stands for "Embedded Sensors Project",
    because it was named before I developed the concept of embedded
    detectors as a different thing from internal sensors.</p>

    <p>The ESP project is currently working in the implementation of
    sensors and detectors for a number of different attacks and
    intrusions, using OpenBSD as an implementation platform. We are
    also using this project as a platform for some other research
    ideas based on the concept of internal sensors.</p>

    <p>We have currently around 50 detectors implemented. My goal is
      to reach approximately 100 detectors for the purposes of
      analysis in my thesis.</p>
