<h1>Using your Pilot with Unix</h1>

    <table width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="red">This page is hopelessly outdated. Please do not use it!</td></tr></table><p>

<p>
All the documentation included with the Pilot for connecting it to
a desktop computer refers to PCs and Macs. Unix users are dutifully
ignored. So a wonderful bunch of people has set to develop all the
software necessary to use their Pilots without having to connect or
use inferior computing platforms. 
<p>
However, as the software is still under development, the documentation
is sparse, and the procedure to make things work is sometimes not very
clear. Since I have been asked a lot of times how to do it, I put together
this page, which contains instructions based on my experience. 
<p>
Please note that I use Solaris 2.5.1 on a Sparc machine, so my instructions
are specific to this platform. The instructions should be general enough
to work on almost any Unix platform, but you may have to discover some
details by yourself. Of course, if you do, please send them to me!
Then we can make this page better by adding system-specific details.
<p><hr>
<b>Note:</b> All the information in this page is based on my direct
experience. If you discover any inaccuracies, omissions or blatant
mistakes, please let me know. If you are the author of one of the tools
described and think I don't have described it correctly, please let
me know, sending me what you would like me to put here.

<ol>
<li>Find which one is the serial port in your machine. 
<p>
<b>In Sparc[5,10,20] and Ultra machines:</b> you have two serial ports,
which are labeled "A" and "B" in the back of your machine, and they
are 25-pin female connectors. 
<p>
<b>In a Sun IPC</b> (maybe IPX and Classic also, if someone has access
to one of those please confirm) the serial ports are labeled "1" and
"2" (if memory serves me correctly, that is my home machine) and they
are 8-pin female mini-DIN connectors, such as those found in Macs.

<li>Get an appropriate converter for connecting the Pilot cradle to
your machine. 
<p>
<b>For a Sparc/Ultra</b>, you can get a 9-pin-male to 25-pin male converter,
or use the 9-pin-male to 25-pin-female one included with your Pilot,
and get a 25-pin-male to 25-pin-male gender changer. 
<li>Find out which device file your operating system uses to communicate
with the physical port you have selected. 
<p>
<b>For Solaris</b>, they will usually be <tt>/dev/ttya</tt> or <tt>/dev/ttyb</tt>.

<p>
<b>For Linux</b>, they may be <tt>/dev/cua0</tt> or <tt>/dev/cua1</tt>.

<li>Plug the cradle to the appropriate port in your machine. <b>Remember
to turn off the machine before plugging or unplugging anything.</b>
Nasty things can happen to serial ports (or to any port, for that matter)
if the wrong pins accidentally touch or short-circuit.

<ol>
<li>Go to <a HREF="ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/">ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/</a>
and get the latest version of pilot-link, which will be named something
like <tt>pilot-link.x.y.z.tar.gz</tt>, where <tt>x.y.z</tt> is the
version number. Pilot-link is the package developed by Kenneth Albanowski
(<a HREF="mailto:kjahds@kjahds.com">kjahds@kjahds.com</a>) that contains
the libraries for communicating with your Pilot from a Unix workstation.
It also includes several programs that make use of the libraries (and
that are useful in various degrees), and bindings for being able to
use the libraries from Java, Perl, Tcl, and Python programs. 
<p>
To compile and install pilot-link: 
<ol type="a">
<li>Uncompress and untar the package: 
<pre>gunzip -c pilot-link.x.y.z.tar.gz | tar xvf -</pre>
<li>Cd to the resulting directory. 
<li>If you have a C compiler (better if it is gcc) installed, normally
the following will work: 
<pre>./configure
make</pre>
<p>
You can give options to <tt>configure</tt> to change parameters such
as the base directory where things will be installed (<tt>/usr/local</tt>
by default) and others. Do a <tt>./configure --help</tt> for all the
options. 
<li>Test that it works by doing: 
<pre>./pilot-xfer port -l</pre>
<p>
where <tt>port</tt> is the device to which your Pilot cradle is connected.
Put the Pilot in the cradle, press the HotSync button, and if things
are ok, you will see a listing in the screen of all the databases installed
in your Pilot. 
<li>Install everything by doing 
<pre>make install</pre>
<li>Optionally, you can install the Perl, Tcl, Java, and/or Python
bindings by doing: 
<pre>
make Perl
make Java
make Tcl
make Python
</pre>
<p>
You can also cd to each directory, <tt>make</tt> and <tt>make test</tt>.
Usually the test program will ask you to put your Pilot in the cradle
and press the HotSync button, and will read some databases or something
like that. 
<p>
I have only been successful with the Perl and Java bindings. The Tcl
keeps crashing when I run the test, and I haven't tried Python. 
</ol>
<li>Play around with the programs. Some of them have man pages, but
most don't. The main programs you will likely use are: 
<dl>
<dt><b>pilot-xfer</b> 
<dd>This is the most evolved program of them all. It allows you to
read, write, and delete databases from the Pilot, list its contents,
backup and restore the Pilot, etc. Run it without arguments to get
a help screen. For example, for installing a <tt>.prc</tt> file you
get from the net, you would do: 
<pre>
pilot-xfer port -i file.prc</pre>
<p>

Where <tt>port</tt> is the device file for the port where your cradle
is connected. 
<p>
Most programs in the pilot-link package understand the following environment
variables, so if you set them, you can usually leave the arguments
out when invoking the commands: 
<p>
<b>PILOTPORT</b> for specifying the port where the cradle is connected.

<p>
<b>PILOTRATE</b> for specifying the rate at which to transfer data.
The default is 9600 baud, which can be slow. I normally use 38400,
which is the higher with which most people report success. 
<dt><b>pilot-mail</b> 
<dd>Allows you to send and receive email from the Mail application
if you have a PalmPilot Professional. Run it with option <tt>-h</tt>
to get a help screen. By default, it tries to access a POP server to
get your new email, downloads it to the Pilot, and sends any email
you have composed in the Pilot. By using the <tt>-m</tt> option, you
can get email from an MH folder instead. What I do is that I have an
MH folder called "topilot" and as I go through my email, I link to
that folder messages that I want to take off-line. At the end of the
day, I do: 
<pre>pilot-mail /dev/ttya -m ~/Mail/topilot -d delete -k delete</pre>
<p>
Actually, I specify all the information in the appropriate environment
variables, which are given in the help screen. 
<p>
I know of no easy way of downloading email from a standard Unix mailbox
to the Pilot. A temporary workaround could be, if you have the MH software
installed, to use the <tt>inc</tt> command to convert the mailbox to
an MH mailbox and use pilot-mail as described above. 
<dt><b>pilot-addresses</b> 
<dd>Can be used to download and upload the AddressBook database, storing
it in a text format in the Unix side. The format is: 
<pre>
"last","first","title","company","work","home","fax","other",
"email","address","city","state","zip","country","custom1",
"custom2","custom3","custom4","note","0"
</pre>
<p>
this is, the order in which the fields appear in the PhoneBook application,
each value in double quotes, separated by commas. The "note" is the
optional note you can add to each record. The "0" at the end, I suppose,
is for marking it as non-private. Every record has to be in a single
line, but you can have as many records per file as you want. 
<p>
You can use this, for example, if you already have an address book
in some other format, to put it all in your Pilot. 
<p>
There is one slightly non-intuitive thing with this program, and it
is that the <tt>-r</tt> option is used to "read from the file, and
<b>write</b> to the Pilot", while the <tt>-w</tt> option means to "read
from the Pilot, and write to the file". I found it confusing, you may
not, but be careful not to wipe out things inadvertently. 
<dt><b>install-datebook, install-memo, install-todos</b> 
<dd>Allow you to install items in the corresponding databases. 
<dt><b>read-expenses, read-todos, read-ical, addresses, memos</b> 
<dd>Allow you to read different items to files in your Unix machine.
<tt>read-ical</tt> reads the DateBook database and writes it in <a HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/Sanjay_Ghemawat/ical/home.html">ical</a>
format. 
<dt><b>pilot-file</b> 
<dd>Dumps a .prc or .pdb file (which must be already in your Unix machine)
in a hex-and-ASCII format. 
<dt><b>install-user</b> 
<dd>Allows you to set the user name that the Pilot keeps in its memory,
and that appears when you start the HotSync application. 
</dl>
<li>Now, pilot-link provides you with the basic command-line tools
for accessing your Pilot, and the libraries for writing your own programs
for doing so. However, The existing applications do not do much in
terms of actually "HotSync'ing" the data, this is, incorporating changes
from the Pilot to the desktop and vice versa, so that you have updated
copies on both sides of the world. 
<p>
This is where <a
HREF="http://www.moshpit.org/pilotmgr/">PilotManager</a> comes in. It
is a graphical application (written in Perl/Tk) developed by <a
HREF="http://www.menalto.com/">Bharat Mediratta</a>, that provides a
framework for running conduits that synchronize different types of
data. Currently, conduits exist for backing up the contents of your
Pilot, for installing new files, and for synchronizing the Date Book
(transferring data in format of Sun's calendar manager) and Memo Pad
(storing the files as ASCII files in a specified directory).
<p>
One problem with PilotManager is that currently it runs only under
Solaris. Sources are provided, but you are mostly on your own if you
want to port it to other system. In the latest version (1.100-BETA-6),
the SyncCM conduit requires the CSA library and rpc.csmd server
included Solaris 2.6, and which is optional in Solaris 2.5.1. So you
may have to install it first if you haven't.
<p>
However, if you have a Solaris machine, good news! PilotManager is
very easy to install and run:
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.moshpit.org/pilotmgr/binaries/">http://www.moshpit.org/pilotmgr/binaries/</a>
and download the latest appropriate version for your machine (it comes
in versions for both Sparc and x86 architectures).
<li>Make sure you have Perl 5.003 or later installed. Really. I tried
with Perl 5.002 and it doesn't run.
<li> As I said before, make sure you have the libcsa library
installed, if you want to successfully use SyncCM.
<li>Unpack the PilotManager tar file.
<li>Edit the <code>PilotManager</code> file, and change the first line
to reflect the location of your Perl interpreter.
<li> If you have version 1.100-B-5 or later and you are not using
precisely Perl 5.003 (this is, you are using something latter, such as
5.004), do the following:
	    <ol>
	      <li><code>cd</code> to the directory where you unpacked
	      PilotManager.</li>
	      <li><code>cd lib/perl5/[arch]</code>, where [arch] will
	      be <code>sun4-solaris</code> or something similar,
	      depending on your architecture.</li>
	      <li><code>mv 5.003 `perl -e 'print $]'`</code></li>
	    </ol>
  This will make PilotManager find the directories it needs
  adequately.
<li>Run <code>PilotManager</code>. If everything is ok, you should
see the main window. Select the "Properties" menu item, select the
appropriate port and speed you want to use, select and configure the
conduits you want to run.
<li>Finally, put your Pilot in the cradle, press the HotSync icon in
PilotManager, press the HotSync button in the cradle, and your Pilot
should start synchronizing.
<li>If you need help, go to the PilotManager home page. There is not
much documentation, but you may find what you need. Also, there is
a mailing list. Help is also included in the program.
</ol>
A few tips regarding PilotManager may be useful:
<ul>
<li>The Backup conduit only learns about the databases you have in
your Pilot every time it executes. So the first time, I recommend running
only the Backup conduit, and then reconfiguring it with the databases
you want to back up, and add any other conduits you want.
<li>If you have a lot of things in your Pilot, and you have all databases
selected for backup, the HotSync may take a long time. I still do not
have a perfect way of dealing with this. What I do is that I periodically
do a full backup of my Pilot with pilot-xfer, and have selected for
backup only the frequently changing databases, such as AddressBookDB,
DateBookDB, etc.
<li> <b>News:</b> the latest version of PilotManager (1.100-BETA-5 and
up) correct the first problem above by reading the database listing at
each sync. Also, the Backup module now includes an option to
automatically back up any new databases that have been added to your
Pilot. A definite welcome addition! Also, now you have the capability
of cancelling a HotSync in progress.
</ul>
