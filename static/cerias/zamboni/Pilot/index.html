    <h1>Diego's Pilot Page</h1>

    <table width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="red">This page is hopelessly outdated. Please do not use it!</td></tr></table><p>

    For some time now, my favorite toy has been a little device called
    the <a href="http://www.usr.com/palm/index.html">PalmPilot</a>,
    built by <a href="http://www.usr.com">U.S. Robotics</a>. This
    little device, apart from being extremely neat for a technological
    gadget fanatic like me, has actually been useful for keeping track
    of appointments, lists of things to do, addresses, and (of course)
    for playing games. Besides, it provides yet another platform to
    program in.<p>

    So this page is devoted to that little gadget. Here you will find
    information that I have collected over time, pointers to
    resources, and any other thing that I can think of.<p>

    <h2>Using a Pilot with Unix</h2>

    One of my biggest problems with the Pilot is that USR only
    makes the desktop software for Windows and Mac. I use only Unix,
    so, like many other people, I was out in the cold, without support
    for HotSync'ing, installing applications in the Pilot, and so many
    other cool things that PC users automatically have upon opening
    their Pilot boxes.<p>

    Fortunately, lots of other people were in the same situation than
    me before me, and a number of efforts were started to provide
    Pilot Unix users with appropriate tools without having to
    downgrade ourselves to using inferior computing platforms.<p>

    The software for Unix is still under heavy development, but it has
    shown to be quite stable, and although documentation is sparse,
    getting things to work is not very hard. To help with the process,
    I have put together <a href="unix-settingup.html">step by step
    instructions</a> for getting started with your Pilot on Unix,
    getting and installing the main tools.

    <h2>Programming for the Pilot under Unix</h2>

    The other great aspect of the Pilot is that all the <a
      href="http://palmpilot.3com.com/devzone/docs.html">API
      specifications and
    headers</a> were made public by USR, so free tools are available
    for building applications under Unix (as the commercial SDK's
    support, of course, only Windows and Mac).<p>

    I have provided simple <a href="unix-develtools.html">step by
    step</a> instructions for getting and compiling all the tools you
    need to develop Pilot applications under Unix.

    <h2>Pilot links</h2>

    Over time, I have collected a number of links pointing to
    different Pilot-related resources. Some of them are <a
    href="bookmarks.html">here</a>.<p>
