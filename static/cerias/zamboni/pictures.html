    <p>Ah, this picture has been the source of many comments among my
    friends and colleagues, who make fun of me because I am so warmly
    dressed. So here is its story.</p>

    <p>This picture was taken during my first semester at Purdue, in
    1996. See, I come from Mexico City, where the lowest temperatures
    (3am-middle-of-the-winter temperatures) are -2 degrees celsius,
    around 30F. The last snowfall in Mexico City was somewhere around
    100 years ago, and it was probably a few flakes that melted on
    contact to the ground. We are not used to low temperatures.</p>

    <p>So there I am, a new grad student trying to survive through
    first-semester classes, qual exams, projects and the like, buried
    almost 24 hours a day in my cubicle, when someone (I believe it
    was <a href="http://www.mastincrosbie.com/">Tanya</a>) came around 
    taking pictures, and insisted that we go outside to take my
    picture. There we went.</p>

    <p>It wasn't really that cold. As you can see, there wasn't even
    snow on the ground. It was probably mid-November, so temperatures
    were probably somewhere between 20-30F. But for me, before having
    survived my first winter in Indiana, it was <b>really, really
    cold</b>. And accordingly, I'm wearing my bear-like heavy coat
    (which I still use today, although I wait until later in the
    winter to bring it out now).</p>

    <p>And yet I'm smiling, or at least trying to. That's why I like
    this picture, and why I keep it around, even if it doesn't do very
    good advertising for Indiana weather-wise. It evokes a time that
    was very trying for me, but very exciting at the same time. And
    now that I am nearing the <a href="vita/">end of my stay</a> at
    Purdue, looking at it brings back a lot of memories.</p>

    <p>Here's a picture taken much more recently, a month or so ago. I
    was right in the middle of finishing a paper for submission to a
    journal. I'm not even trying to smile here. I was probably
    thinking of going to sleep and nothing more. How time changes
    people :-)</p>

    So there. That heavy-coat picture is probably going to be around
    for a while more.
