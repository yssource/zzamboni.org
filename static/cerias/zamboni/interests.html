    <h1>My interests</h1>

    <h2>Personal activities</h2>

    <p>I enjoy spending time with my wife <a
    href="https://sorianoramirez.org">Susana</a>. She also works at CERIAS, so
    seeing each other is usually not much of a problem. As of lately,
    as I have had to devote more and more time to my thesis work, I
    don't spend as much time at home as I would like to, but hopefully
    that will change when I graduate.</p>

    <p>A few years ago, I started practicing <a
    href="http://www.ii.uib.no/~arild/fencing/faq/Top-view.html">fencing</a>,
    and it has been a part of my life on-and-off since then. For some
    time I practiced with the <a
    href="http://expert.cc.purdue.edu/~fencing/">Purdue Fencing
    Club</a>, but I abandoned it in favor of karate.</p>

    <p>In February of 1998 I started practicing <a
    href="http://expert.cc.purdue.edu/~shotokan/docs/karate/karate.html">Shoto-kan
    Karate</a> in the <a
    href="http://expert.cc.purdue.edu/~shotokan/">Purdue Challenge
    Karate Club</a>. I found karate to be a very rewarding activity,
    both mentally and physically. I enthusiastically recommend it to
    anyone, no matter what your age of physical condition
    is. Unfortunately, the time constraints of my work (particularly
    <a href="vita/">nearing graduation</a>) have made me stop
    practicing it.</p>

    <p>So I have no official non-computer-related hobbies now. It's
    all work, work, work. Agh.</p>

    <h2>Computer-related activities</h2>

    <p>At work, my main interest is computer security. But you can
      read about that <a href="school.html#research">somewhere
	else</a>.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy using computers as well. I like
    playing games. Lately I have particularly enjoyed Unreal
    Tournament and Deus Ex.</p>

    <p>I also like doing system administration work at home. I will
    add more information here about our home machines and network
    someday.<p>
