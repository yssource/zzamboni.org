    <h1>Diego's software and hacks page</h1>

    <p>Over time I have written a large number of programs, some
    large, but most of them small scripts to do little useful
    things. Many of them have well-known and much more evolved
    equivalents, but I keep using my versions of them because most of
    the time I wrote them before I learned about the other programs
    (or before they existed), because they keep doing what I want, and
    because I can tweak them if they don't.</p>

    <p>So here's my list (which is not complete - I will add as I have
    time to scavenge through my home directory). No documentation for
    most of these, use at your own risk, yada yada yada. Enjoy.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt> <b><a href="http://mailer.sourceforge.net/">Mailer</a></b>
      <dd> A program for managing aliases and lists. One of my larger
        publicly-available projects, it has its own web page.<p>

      <dt> <b><a href="files/auctl.tar.gz">auctl</a></b>
      <dd> A little program I wrote for controlling audio on
	Solaris. You can control the volume, muting, and output
	port. I should probably add balance control too, but I
	haven't. Sample uses:
	<pre>
auctl vol =10		Set volume to 10 (in a 0-255 scale)
auctl vol 15		Increase volume by 15
auctl vol -10		Reduce volume by 10
auctl mute		Toggle muting
auctl port spkr		Toggle output on the internal speaker
	</pre>
	<p>The -v option makes it be chatty about what it's doing.</p>
	<p>I have keys mapped in my window manager to different
	invokations of this command, so I can control the volume from
	my keyboard.</p>
	  
      <dt> <b><a href="http://grabcartoons.sourceforge.net/">grabcartoons</a></b>
      <dd> Of course, I have also written (in Perl) my own version of
      a program for getting comics off the net. It has its own web page now.<p>

      <dt><b><a href="files/cronsort.pl">cronsort.pl</a></b>
      <dd> A program for sorting a crontab file chronologically. Use
           with care, I'm not responsible if it messes up your
           crontab.<p>

      <dt><b><a href="files/mhutils.tar.gz">mhutils</a></b>
      <dd> A collection of scripts and configuration files for
      managing email using MH and <a
      href="http://www.beedub.com/exmh/">exmh</a>. Also includes some patches
      for exmh and <a href="http://www.fiction.net/blong/programs/gbuffy/">Gbuffy</a> that I use.<p>

    </dl>

    more to come...
