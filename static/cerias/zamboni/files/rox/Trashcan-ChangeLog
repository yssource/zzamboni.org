	* AppInfo.xml: Renamed AppMenu to AppInfo.xml, to comply with the
	newest versions of Rox-Filer. AppInfo.xml. Change suggested almost 
	simultaneously by Renato Ramonda and K.M. Klingsporn.

	* AppRun: Made it use link instead of symlink to set AppIcon.xpm,
	because the latest version of ROX-Filer disallows AppIcons to be
	symlinks.
	Now that AppMenus are a standard part of ROX-Filer, I have
	disabled by default the generation of an "Empty trashcan" script
	whenever there is something in the trashcan. It can be reenabled
	by setting $UseEmptyProgram to 1 in the configuration section.

	* AppRun: Made it strip the hostname from the beginning of the
	filenames if it is included. For now we just assume all the files
	are local.

	* AppRun: Added a configuration hash for icons, where they can be
	accessed by name (%TrashIcons).
	Modularized things a little more, adding subroutines set_icon(),
	flip_icons(), roxupdate() and roxupdate_cmd().
	(empty_trash): Added an experimental feature for periodically
 	(every 5 seconds by default) blinking the trash icon while it is
 	being emptied. This allows the user to see that something is going 
	on for operations that take too long. This mechanism for now uses
	signals, so it may not work correctly or produce weird behavior
	sometimes, because I'm not being particularly careful about the
	signals. For this reason this feature is disabled by default
	(controlled by the $BlinkTrashcan variable). Using signals is not
	really necessary, but is more convenient for now because I'm using 
	File::Path to remove the trash directory, and it has no way of
	periodically calling a subroutine.
	Made it try the mv command if File::Copy::move fails. That
	subroutine does not handle cross-filesystem moves, whereas the mv
	command usually does.
	The icon blinking also happens while moving files to the trashcan, 
	in case that operation takes long.

	* Version 0.2
	
	* AppRun: Made it use the -x option instead of -i and -W. Also
	made the trashcan directory by default be $AppRun/Trashcan instead
	of $HOME/.trashcan.
