    I discovered a project called <a
    href="http://rox.sourceforge.net/">ROX</a>, which includes a very
    nice desktop-and-file manager (ROX-Filer), a nice MIME-association
    mechanism, and some other applications. ROX-Filer is the first
    desktop manager I have actually been using on my Unix desktop (I'm
    accustomed to it on my Mac at home, but no other desktop manager
    had felt "right" on Unix without using enormous amounts of
    memory).<p>

      I have written several patches for ROX-Filer that you can find
      at the <a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/patch/?group_id=7023">project's
      patch page</a>. Some of them have already been incorporated into 
      the CVS tree, so please check before applying them.<p>

      I have written a number of things for ROX-Filer:

      <ul>

      <li> A patch for supporting application-specific menus. This
      patch has been incorporated into CVS, so if you get the latest
      version from CVS, you'll have it. <b>NOTE: On March 8, 2001, the
      CVS was updated, converting AppMenu to XML format. I have
      updated all the applications in this page to use the new format.</b><p>

	  <li> A <a href="../files/rox/appmenu_convert.pl">program</a>
	  for converting the old AppMenu format into the new XML
	  format.<p>

      <li> A <a
	  href="../files/rox/Trashcan.tar.gz">Trashcan application</a>
	for ROX-Filer, originally inspired by
	dfm-trashcan.tcl (from <a
	  href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~etgold/software/mycode.html">Ethan's
	  Code Kitchen</a>), but rewritten in Perl and now with very
	different functionality, and specifically tailored for
	ROX-Filer (<i>last update: April 8, 2002 - see the <a
	href="../files/rox/Trashcan-ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a></i>).<p>
      
      <li> A <a href="../files/rox/XEmacs.tar.gz">wrapper for XEmacs</a>,
	which tries to use a client instead of starting a new xemacs
	if possible, and keeps a cache of recently opened files using
	the app-specific menus mechanism (see the patches page
	above) (<i>last update: March 8, 2001</i>).<p>

      <li> A <a href="../files/rox/LaTeX.tar.gz">wrapper for LaTeX</a>,
      which tries to be somewhat intelligent about how to process its
      arguments, and also uses the app-specific menus mechanism if you 
      have it installed (<i>last udpate: March 8, 2001</i>).<p>

      <li> A <a href="../files/rox/xTerminal.tar.gz">terminal
      wrapper</a> which is able to execute different terminal programs 
      by using its arguments (to be used with the app-specific menus
      mechanism) (<i>last update: March 8, 2001</i>).<p>

      <li> A <a href="../files/rox/Utils.tar.gz">miscellaneous utility 
      application</a>, which provides some useful functions through
      its app-specific menu (<i>last update: March 8, 2001</i>).<p>

      <li> Simple wrappers for <a href="../files/rox/XDvi.tar.gz">xdvi</a>,
	<a href="../files/rox/XFig.tar.gz">xfig</a>, <a
	href="../files/rox/XV.tar.gz">XV</a>, <a
	href="../files/rox/Display.tar.gz">display</a>.<p>

    </ul>

      As I write more things for ROX, I will post them here.
