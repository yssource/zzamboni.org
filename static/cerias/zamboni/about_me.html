<H1>About me</H1>

<H2>(Very) Brief vita</H2>

<P>I was born in Corrientes, Argentina, one sunny morning in December
3rd, 1970. However, I have lived in Mexico since age 2, for which, for
all practical reasons, I consider myself a Mexican (that's my official
nationality now, too).</P>

<P>Currently I am living in West Lafayette, IN, a small town in the
middle east of the U.S., whose main attraction (why I am here, anyway)
is that it is home of <A HREF="http://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue
University</A>.</P>

<p>A longer history of my life can be found in my <a
href="vita/">vita</a>.</p>

<H2>Previous lives</H2>

<P>I finished my undergraduate studies as a Computer Engineer in the
<A HREF="http://www.unam.mx/">National Autonomous University of Mexico
(UNAM)</A>, in the<A HREF="http://www.cecafi.unam.mx/">School of
Engineering</A>. My bachelor's thesis, entitled &quot;UNAM/Cray
Computer Security Project&quot;, was the foundation for the <A
HREF="http://www.asc.unam.mx">Computer Security Area</A>, which
I founded and was head of until I entered Purdue.</P>

<P>While I was finishing my studies at UNAM (and a couple of years
after that), I worked at UNAM's <A
HREF="http://www.museovirtual.unam.mx/museo/dgsca.html">Center for
Academic Computing Services</A>, in the <A
HREF="http://www.super.unam.mx/">Supercomputing Department</A>,
and later, as I already said, in the <A
HREF="http://www.asc.unam.mx/">Computer Security Area</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="contact"></A>How to contact me</H2>

<P>Definitely the easiest way of getting ahold of me is by electronic
mail. My address is 
zamboni at the domain cerias dot purdue dot edu.
I encourage you to use PGP if what you are sending is private. My
public key can be accessed <A HREF="pgp_key.txt">here</A>.</P>

<P>By snail-mail, you can find me in the following address:</P>
