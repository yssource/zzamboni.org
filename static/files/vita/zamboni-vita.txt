  • An active worm-detection system, in wide deployment in the IBM
    worldwide internal network. Billy Goat listens for connections to
    unused IP address ranges and actively responds to those connections
    to accurately detect worm-infected machines, and in many cases
    capture the worms themselves. Billy Goat is engineered for
    distributed deployment, with each device containing standalone
    detection and reporting capabilities, together with data
    centralization features that allow network-wide data analysis and
    reporting.

    Goat to accurately detect local infected machines and prevent them
    from establishing connections to the outside, limiting the
    propagation of the worms to the outside network.
