  • Billy Goat was the first instance of what is today called
    /honeypots/ and /honeynets/.
    ⁃ An active worm-detection system, widely deployed (at the time) in
      the IBM worldwide internal network. It listens for connections to
      unused IP address ranges and actively responds to those
      connections to accurately detect worm-infected machines, and in
      many cases capture the worms themselves. Billy Goat is engineered
      for distributed deployment, with each device containing standalone
      detection and reporting capabilities, together with data
      centralization features that allow network-wide data analysis and
      reporting.

    Goat to accurately detect local infected machines and prevent them
